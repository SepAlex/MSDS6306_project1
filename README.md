We will analyze the beer industry, see its past trends, production and supply mechanics, and evaluate future outlook. Our study is geered towards understanding the beer industry and establishing expansion possibilities for our client, on grounds that the beer industry is flourishing and the demand is insatiable. This study will reveal the market competition and whether the industry has potential  for growth and how far it from saturation. Analysing the industry's landsacpe to help our client determine whether it is beneficial to invest  on expansion either throug purchasing existing breweries or establishhing new ones ad oin whcih locations.
Our study will provide a birds eye view on the overal brewing industry.

We hope answer the following questions; how many breweries are there and how are they distributed in the country; Which brewery ranks highest in production; what brands of beer are produced most; How many ounces are commonly produced; Which brewery produces most brands of beer; which location produces most beer; among others.

This study will help our client understand what stage the industry is at i.e. whether it is still growing or its nearing a plataeu. Our client will understand how many competitors are i the industry; and what type of beer they are producing.

We caution however, that this study only focuses on production, location, type of beer and size. A correspsonding report on financials should be considered pari pasu our report. As such, additional research  on brewing profitability may be critical before making investement decision.
